# A Users Review of Dragon Professional Individual 15: A Personal Perspective

>	**Speech recognition is the ability of a machine or program to identify words  and phrases in spoken language and convert to a machine-readable formatâ€¦ More, a sophisticated software I think [that] has the ability to accept natural language and interact Dragon modeling.**<sup>[1]</sup>

### These are my experiences using Dragon Professional Individual 15, and being that is my review, it might be different than other reviews.

As a full-time user of [Dragon Professional Individual 15](https://shop.nuance.com/store/nuanceus/Custom/pbpage.dragonProINDV/?utm_medium=ps&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=dragon&utm_term=dragon%20professional&cvokeywordid=33|304216&cvosrc=ps.Google.dragon%20professional&gclid=CjwKCAjwmqHPBRBQEiwAOvbR822IvhdEQqSCeZJTJ9_XjupELKp0A75m8KGojMsrZ3qq2hpJ9pFD2RoC2JEQAvD_BwE) (DPI 15), this is my review. If it Were  not for this speech recognition software I would not be able to use the computer due to the unmanageableness of using the keyboard and mouse .

You see, as a man with a physal disability. I use a wheelchair and have severely limited use of my arms and hands. I feel that I am more than qualified to share with you what I have learned of DPI 15.

If it were not for Dragon in all its many incarnations, from its first inception of the original Dragon Dictate, in 1992, through to it's current version of DPI 15, released in 2016, now owned and operated by [Nuance](http://www.nuanice.com) Maintaining and improving upon speech recognition.

Although Dragon Dictate, the speech recognition software, was designed primarily for dictation. It can also be used to effectively control the computer, in regards to user interface functions such as buttons, menus and dialog boxes. This virtually gives the user hands-free use of the computer. Thus, it gained much acceptance amongst the  disabled population, 

In college I purchased my first computer, and I kept thinking that there ought to be a better way to handle the inputting and manipulating the data. At the time , nothing prognosticating on the market. In 1994, I began reading about a new company, Dragon Systems, Inc., that offered a new ground breaking software that enabled the user to virtually control the computer, and dictate with just your voice.. Thus, introducing, into the market.**"Speech Recognition"**.

Well I was all over that and I arranged for a I hands-on demonstration with the retailer to try it out in all its details. It did not take all that much to convince me. I purchased it,  along with the software, a computer. My first computer I could talk to and it would do  what I needed.
