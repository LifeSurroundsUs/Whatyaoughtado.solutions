# A Users Review of Dragon Professional Individual 15: A Personal Perspective


> **Speech recognition is the ability of a machine or program to identify words and phrases in spoken language and convert to a machine-readable format...More, a sophisticated software [that] has the ability to accept natural language modeling.**


### These are my experiences using Dragon Professional Individual 15, and being that is my review, it might be different than other reviews.


As a full-time user of [Dragon Professional Individual 15](https://shop.nuance.com/store/nuanceus/Custom/pbpage.dragonProINDV/?utm_medium=ps&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=dragon&utm_term=dragon%20professional&cvokeywordid=33|304216&cvosrc=ps.Google.dragon%20professional&gclid=CjwKCAjwmqHPBRBQEiwAOvbR822IvhdEQqSCeZJTJ9XjupELKp0A75m8KGojMsrZ3qq2hpJ9pFD2RoC2JEQAvD_BwE) (DPI 15), this is my review. If it were  not for this speech recognition software I would not be able to use the computer, due to the unmanageableness of using the keyboard and mouse .


You see, as a man with a physal [disability][Friedreich's Ataxia, A Neurological progressive  isorder which causes me to my speech]. I use a wheelchair and have severely limited use of my arms and hands. I feel that I am more than qualified to share with you what I have learned of [DPI 15](https://shop.nuance.com/store/nuanceus/Custom/pbpage.dragonProINDV/?utm_medium=ps&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=dragon&utm_term=dragon%20professional&cvokeywordid=33|304216&cvosrc=ps.Google.dragon%20professional&gclid=CjwKCAjwmqHPBRBQEiwAOvbR822IvhdEQqSCeZJTJ9XjupELKp0A75m8KGojMsrZ3qq2hpJ9pFD2RoC2JEQAvD_BwE).


If it were not for Dragon in all its many incarnations, from its first inception of the original Dragon Dictate, in 1992, through to it's current version of DPI 15, released in 2016, now owned and operated by [Nuance](http://www.nuanice.com), menitaining and improving speech recognition.


Although, Dragon Dictate originally, then more commonly known as Dragon , called NaturallySpeaking, and now known as Dragon Professional Individual 15,   was designed primarily for dictation, it can also be used to effectively control the computer,  in regards to user interface operational use of the buttons, menus and dialog boxes. **This virtually gives the user hands-free use of the computer. Thus, it gained much acceptance amongst the  disabled population,**


In college I purchased my first computer, and I kept thinking that there **ought to be a better way** to handle inputting and manipulating the data, other than the mouse. At the time, there was nothing prognosticating on the market. In 1994, I began reading about a new company, Dragon Systems, Inc., that offered a new ground breaking software that enabled the user to virtually control the computer, and dictate with just your voice.. Thus, introducing, into the market **"Speech Recognition"**.

Well, I was all over that and I arranged for a hands-on demonstration with the retailer, of Dragon, to try it out, in all its details. It did not take all that much to convince me. I purchased Dragon Dictate, the software, and a computer set up for Dragon Dictate. My first computer I could talk to and it would do  what I needed.

There are many other features I did not include in this review. If you would like to read more, you can find them on the web.

There is a learning curve. I won't try and you tell you there is none. But  like any program or application we decide to use, in the beginning it's very hard to remember all the commands and extras. We know what we want to say and we will learn what we need to learn to dictate using Dragon Professional Individual 15. Even, after many years, I continue to learn. 


Some people say it is simple and get it right of. While others say the curve to be too difficult and get all caught up in trying to remember all the commands. Don't give up. There are plenty of cheatsheets and an *extensive help system* within Dragon itself, and if you need further help here are just a few websites offering help.

### **Speech recognition microphones**


There is a need to talk about microphones. After all, we are speaking to a computer and we need a device to handle our speech input, and in this case is an analog-to-digital coveretor that will translate the analog sound waves of your voice into digital data, which then goes through several complex stages, to show up on your computer display as text.


If you would like to read further about how to speech recognition works [read here](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/speech-recognition1.htm)


There are many different types of microphones.

+ Headset, Wired and Wireless </span>
+ Handheld 
+ Speciality
+ Desktop 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Headset microphones are probably the most common and most  popular. They are the most accurate and have the best noise cancellation available. I have had several over the years and found them to .be.excellent, but found them difficult to put into postion,  and my hands constantly would get caught in the wires and pull the headset out of postion or rip the wires out of their sockets. Needless to say, they were not for me.


The Handheld microphones, are attached with a cord, unless it's wireless, and held by the hand to postion the microphone into the optimal placement. The microphones are rated to be amongst the top in accuracy. Even Nuance has it's own brand.


The Specialty microphones are used primarily if you are moving the computer from place to place, like in traveling or putting your computer into a carrying pack. You might use one for a laptop, or for a Tablet or a Mobile Device. They are small, adaptable and easy to mount and disassemble for transport.


The Desktop or more commonly called the Tabletop microphones sit on your desktop or table and are stationary. This is the type of microphone I use, a Vec GN-USB. comparable to the SoundTech GN-USB-t.  Both out these of.microphones are hypothetically rated to be noise canceling, just don't count on it. The microphone hears all the groans, and coughs, and the response is more than adequate for speech recognition.  Because of my constant movement, closer and further away from the microphone, the far-reaching technology, the processor that internally adjust, to whatever distance you are from the microphone.
